<H1>SQL2GDB UDF Discovery</H1>
<P>
This document describes the user-defined function (UDF)
discovery mechanism that the <B>MS SQL and Access To InterBase Wizard</B>
(<B>SQL2GDB</B> for short) uses. This document is meant
for developrs or administrators who wish to add new
libraries to the SQL2GDB wizard, troubleshoot migration
problems, and the terminally curious.
</P>

<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>
Before any other step takes place, SQL2GDB enables the user to
load User-Defined Functions into the database. This
is done simply by declaring them before any other
script is executed.
</P><P>
Using UDF libraries allows the
developer to create more complex scripts and have
additional functionality when developing stored procedures
and triggers. It also enables SQL2GDB to do some advanced
tricks, like importing blobs from text files or (in the
future) enabling advanced features such as mailing and
scripting on the database server.
</P>

<H2>Discovery</H2>

<P>
SQL2GDB has no hardcoded libraries with UDFs to declare
to the database. Rather, it dynamically inspects
the directory it runs in, and allows the user to select which
UDF libraries to declare in one of the customization steps.
</P><P>
SQL2GDB will examine the directory from which it is
executed, listing all files with a <B>sql</B> extension.
These are candidates for migration.
</P><P>
Because an SQL script needs to be executed for each
function to be imported, a file named
<CODE><I>library_name</I>_setup.sql</CODE> is expected
to be found on that same folder. For example, the
SQL file describing the required SQL statements to
declare functions from <CODE>MyUDFs.dll</CODE> should
be named <CODE>MyUDFs_setup.sql</CODE>. This condition
is enforced to enable later versions of SQL2GDB to
deploy the libraries as needed.
</P><P>
The files with declarations should have the statements one
after the other, finishing with a semicolon.
The wizard does not check whether the syntax is correct or
the files are available, but will detect the server's
complaint if this is the case.
</P><P>
The following listing is used, for example, to import
some of the FreeUDFLib functions, available from
<A HREF='ftp://firebird.sourceforge.net/pub/firebird/download/freeudflib.zip'>
ftp://firebird.sourceforge.net/pub/firebird/download/freeudflib.zip</A>.
</P>

<P><PRE>
/* Blob functions */

declare external function f_BlobMaxSegmentLength
  blob
  returns integer by value
  entry_point 'BlobMaxSegmentLength' module_name 'FreeUDFLib.dll';

declare external function f_BlobSegmentCount
  blob
  returns integer by value
  entry_point 'BlobSegmentCount' module_name 'FreeUDFLib.dll';

</PRE></P>

<P>
In particular, for the FreeUDFLib library, the supplied
<B>ext_funcs.sql</B> works fine. It should be renamed
<B>FreeUDFLib_setup.sql</B>, however, to have the
wizard recognize it. The renamed <B>FreeUDFLib_setup.sql</B>
file is supplied with this distribution.
</P><P>
<B>Important</B>: to be used with InterBase 6, libraries
should be copied to the <B>UDF</B> directory under the
installation. They won't run if they are placed anywhere
else.
</P>
