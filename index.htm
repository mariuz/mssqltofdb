<H1>MSSQL And Access To InterBase Migration Wizard</H1>
<H2>Birthday Boy Edition</H2>
<P>
This document describes the <B>MSSQL And Access To InterBase
Migration Wizard</B> (<I>Wizard</I> for short), and provides
and introduction to the homepage on <A HREF=
'http://www.ibphoenix.com'>IBPhoenix</A>.
</P>

<P>
The Wizard (also known as <B>sql2gdb</B> is a small application
which helps migrate database
from Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Access to InterBase. The
application is Open Source, and for the moment is not protected
under any license. You can copy it, distribute it, modify it,
and do whatever you want with it, as long as you take full
responsability.
<!--
However, if you attempt to claim it as yours
and sell it, your nose will grow, you will burn in hell for
all eternity, you will lose all sex drive, and other miscellaneous
<B>Bad Stuff (tm)</B> will happen to you.
So there.

<P>
As a historical note, the <B>Access To InteBase Wizard</B>
(also known as <B>mdb2gdb</B>) was a previous version,
which was distributed through the
<A HREF='http://www.egroups.com/group/IB-Conversions'>IBConversions</A>
e-group. The mdb2gdb wizard is no longer under development,
because its functionality has been superceded by sql2gdb.
If you still have a copy of mdb2gdb around, do yourself
a favor and download this new Wizard.

Here you have links to available files. You can also try
some other sites, if IBPhoenix is too busy. Note that the
Wizard has a built-in update mechanism, so if you start it
while connected to the Internet, you will receive instructions
on how to get the latest release.
