<H1>InterBase Software Updates System</H1>
<P>
This document describes an implementation to update
InterBase applications over the Internet, enabling
notifications to be posted at a central site, and
clients to poll for software updates.
</P>

<HR>
<H2>Update Mechanism</H2>
<P>
To find out if newer software is available a client
program should request a document from a well-known
URL.
</P>

<P>
The document should then be parsed by the client
program, to inform the user about newer releases,
notifications, and where to obtain them.
</P>

<P>
The document has the following format:<PRE>

document  ::= &lt;header&gt;
              CRLF
              [(&lt;topic&gt;)]

header    ::= major_version "." minor_version
              CRLF
              last_update_date
              CRLF
              topic_count

topic     ::= &lt;topic_header&gt;
              [(&lt;topic_body&gt;)]

topic_header  ::= topic_name
                  CRLF
                  topic_description
                  CRLF
                  last_update_date
                  CRLF
                  body_line_count

topic_body    ::= [(body_line)]
</PRE></P>

<P>
<B>major_version</b> is an integer number. Changes
in this number mean that backward compatibility
was broken in some way. <B>minor_version</B> is
an integer number. Changes to this number mean that
there is extended information, but that older
clients can still interpret this correctly.
<B>last_update_date</B> is the date the document last
updated in any way, in <B>yyyy.mm.dd.hh.nn</B> format.
<B>topic_count</B> is the number of topics which
follow the document header.
</P>

<P>
<B>topic_name</B> is a short name, which uniquely
identifies a notification topic. It is typically
a file name. <B>topic_description</B> is a
user-friendly description of the notification
topic. <B>last_update_date</B> is the date of
the last update issues on this topic, in
<B>yyyy.mm.dd.hh.nn</B> format. <B>body_line_count</B>
is the number of lines the body of the topic has.
</P>

<P>
The body of the document is a plain-text sequence
of lines, which are meant for the user to read. Among
the contents of the body, it is expected that the
following topics will be addressed:
</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Why there is a notification.</LI>
  <LI>What changes have been made.</LI>
  <LI>Where can the newer version of the software
    be obtained.</LI>
  <LI>Where to ask for further assitance.</LI>
</UL>

<HR>
<H2>User Interface Guidelines</H2>
<P>
There are two instances in which the software
updates system should be run: automatically, on
application startup, and on-demand.
</P>

<P>
The automatic startup should be performed silently.
The application should not connect to the Internet
if the user isn't already connected. If any errors
arise, they should be silently discarded. If updates
to the relevant software are found, then the user
should be notified in a non-modal window.
</P>

<P>
The on-demand scenario occurs when the user
explicitly requests that updates be checked. Errors
<B>should</B> be reported. If updates to any software
are found, then the user should be notified in
a modal window.
</P>
